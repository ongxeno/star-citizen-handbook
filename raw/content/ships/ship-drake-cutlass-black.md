## **Core Identity and Acquisition**

The Drake Cutlass Black stands as one of the most recognizable and ubiquitous vessels in the persistent universe of *Star Citizen*. Its identity is built on a foundation of rugged utility and accessibility, positioning it as a critical step for pilots graduating from starter-class ships. This section details the ship's fundamental statistics and its place within the in-game economy.

* **Ship Name:** Cutlass Black  
* **Manufacturer:** Drake Interplanetary  
* **Primary Role(s):** Multi-Role, Medium Freight, Light Gunship, Militia/Patrol.1 While historically considered a fighter, its flight characteristics as of Alpha 4.2.1 align it more closely with a heavily armed patrol or gunship platform.  
* **In-game Price (aUEC):** 2,116,800 aUEC 2

The market positioning of the Cutlass Black is a cornerstone of its enduring popularity. With a price point just over 2.1 million aUEC, it occupies a strategic tier above entry-level ships like the Aurora or Mustang, but remains significantly more affordable than its direct competitors in the medium multi-role class, such as the MISC Freelancer or Crusader Spirit C1, which are priced over 3 million aUEC.4 This makes the Cutlass Black the quintessential "value" proposition and a logical first major investment for new players. Its cost directly reflects its "jack of all trades, master of none" nature, offering a functional entry into numerous gameplay loops—including cargo hauling, vehicle transport, and multicrew combat—without requiring the substantial financial commitment of a more specialized vessel.6

For players seeking to acquire the Cutlass Black, it is readily available for purchase and rental within the Stanton system. The following table consolidates all necessary acquisition data as of Alpha 4.2.1.

## **Strategic Overview and Role Analysis**

The Drake Cutlass Black is a vessel defined by a stark contrast between its manufacturer's official narrative and its practical application by the citizens of the 'verse. Drake Interplanetary officially markets the ship as a cost-effective solution for local militia units, emphasizing that its generous cargo hold and standard-issue tractor mount are intended for "search and rescue operations".2 However, its potent combination of accessible firepower, cargo capacity, and low operational cost has cemented its unofficial reputation as the quintessential ship for pirates, smugglers, and independent mercenaries. It is a symbol of rugged, no-frills autonomy, frequently associated with those operating on the fringes of the law.1

### **Design Philosophy: The Drake Standard**

The Cutlass Black is the poster child for Drake's "function over form" design ethos. Every aspect of the ship prioritizes practicality and affordability over aesthetics, comfort, or even crew survivability. The interior is spartan and industrial, lacking amenities common in other ships of its class, such as a dedicated lavatory.8 The hull is notoriously fragile, with a community reputation for losing components like engine nacelles with alarming ease; one user aptly noted it "loses parts as soon as something sneezes in your direction".9 This philosophy is perhaps best encapsulated by the popular saying, "If you own Drake stock, make sure you also own Duct Tape Stock".8 The result is a ship that is cheap to acquire and maintain but lacks the inherent durability of its competitors from manufacturers like MISC or the refined design of Crusader Industries.1

### **Key Strengths**

* **Unmatched Versatility:** The Cutlass Black's single greatest asset is its ability to perform a wide array of tasks competently. It can engage in PVE combat up to Very High-Risk Targets (VHRTs), haul a respectable 46 SCU of cargo, transport essential ground vehicles like the ROC mining vehicle, and serve as an effective dropship for FPS missions.6 This flexibility makes it an ideal "gateway ship," allowing a pilot to sample numerous professions before committing to a more specialized vessel.7  
* **Potent Firepower:** For its price class, the Cutlass Black delivers formidable damage output. The pilot controls four Size 3 weapon hardpoints, supplemented by a powerful, well-placed dorsal turret equipped with two additional Size 3 guns. With a dedicated gunner, the ship can project a significant volume of fire, making it a serious threat in multicrew engagements.2  
* **Superior Vehicle Transport:** The spacious cargo bay, accessed via a wide rear ramp, is perfectly configured to carry the popular Greycat ROC, making the Cutlass the default choice for players engaging in the profitable ROC mining gameplay loop.2 Furthermore, its large port and starboard side doors add immense tactical value, enabling rapid deployment for on-foot missions or providing cover fire from within the ship.2  
* **Heavy Missile Payload:** The ship comes standard with a formidable missile arsenal, including racks for eight Size 3 and eight Size 2 missiles. With equipment swaps, this can be reconfigured to carry as many as 48 Size 1 missiles, allowing it to function as a potent missile boat to initiate combat encounters with overwhelming alpha damage.2

### **Key Weaknesses**

* **Compromised Maneuverability (Post-4.2.1):** A sweeping flight model rebalance in Alpha 4.2.1 delivered a significant blow to the Cutlass Black's agility. Once nimble enough to be considered a heavy fighter, it is now sluggish and unresponsive in turns, with pilots comparing its handling to a "brick" or the much larger Constellation series before its own rebalance.12 This is arguably its most critical weakness in the current game version and fundamentally alters its combat role.  
* **Extreme Fragility:** The ship's defenses are notably poor. It is equipped with only a single Size 2 shield generator, which is inadequate for absorbing sustained fire.14 This is compounded by its notoriously exposed engine nacelles, which are large targets and, when destroyed, leave the ship crippled and spinning uncontrollably.9  
* **Poor Cockpit Visibility:** The pilot's view is heavily obstructed by thick structural frames and struts. This design flaw significantly limits situational awareness in combat and can make precision landings on uneven terrain or within tight hangars unnecessarily difficult.8  
* **Dated "Non-Gold Standard" Design:** As one of the older ships in the game, the Cutlass Black has not yet received a "gold standard" design pass. It lacks modern features such as physicalized component bays for in-field repair, a fully functional engineering station, and an updated interior layout. This can lead to a less immersive experience and gameplay-affecting bugs.16

The ship's defining characteristic is its versatility, but this strength is also the source of its primary weakness. For every role the Cutlass Black can perform, a direct competitor can perform it better. The MISC Freelancer offers superior durability and pilot firepower for combat and hauling.15 The Crusader Spirit C1 provides a larger, more efficient cargo hold and a vastly superior flight experience for solo operators.9 This positions the Cutlass Black not as an ultimate endgame ship, but as a transitional one. It is the ideal platform for a pilot to

*discover* which gameplay loop they enjoy most before investing in a vessel that specializes in that role, perfectly embodying the "gateway ship" philosophy.7

## **Exterior and Cargo**

The exterior design of the Cutlass Black is purely functional, featuring a distinctive, asymmetrical cockpit and large, rotating engine nacelles. Its layout is optimized for rapid ingress and egress of both personnel and material.

* **Entry/Exit Points:**  
  * **Rear Ramp:** The primary access point, providing a wide entrance for loading vehicles, cargo, and crew.2  
  * **Side Airlocks (x2):** Large sliding doors on the port and starboard sides of the cargo bay. These are invaluable for EVA (Extra-Vehicular Activity), facilitating salvage or rescue operations, and serve as tactical firing positions during ground assaults.2  
  * **Cockpit Canopy:** While not a standard entrance, the cockpit canopy can be opened and used for emergency access.  
* **Cargo Capacity (SCU):**  
  * **46 SCU** (Standard Cargo Units).2  
* **Cargo Loading Mechanism:**  
  * The primary cargo grid is located within the main hull, accessed via the rear ramp. This internal configuration protects cargo from environmental hazards and some degree of hostile fire.  
  * The ship comes equipped with a default **Size 1 SureGrip Tractor Beam** mounted on a utility hardpoint just above the rear ramp.2 This tool is intended to assist with loading and unloading cargo, particularly in zero-gravity environments, though its practical utility can be inconsistent due to game bugs.5

The value of the Cutlass Black's cargo bay extends far beyond its raw 46 SCU capacity. An analysis of its common use cases reveals that the *design* of the bay is its most significant feature. While a ship like the MISC Freelancer offers more total SCU, its cargo bay is long and narrow, making vehicle transport awkward.15 The Cutlass, by contrast, features a wide, open bay and a broad ramp, perfectly suited for the ROC mining vehicle.12 This, combined with the tactical advantage of the large side doors for FPS missions, transforms the cargo hold from a simple storage area into a versatile mission bay.9 Therefore, when evaluating the ship for gameplay that blends vehicle transport, on-foot combat, and cargo hauling, the Cutlass's superior bay design often outweighs the higher SCU count of its competitors.

## **Interior Layout**

The interior of the Cutlass Black reflects the Drake Interplanetary ethos: spartan, functional, and devoid of creature comforts. The space is divided into a forward cockpit and a rear section combining living quarters with the cargo bay.

* **Cockpit:**  
  * **Crew Seats:** The cockpit accommodates a pilot and a co-pilot/RIO (Radar Intercept Officer). The co-pilot can manage ship subsystems such as power distribution and shields, freeing the pilot to focus on flying and firing.2 A third seat for the turret gunner is located separately in the main cabin.  
* **Living Amenities:**  
  * **Beds (x2):** Allows for two crew members to log out in space, preserving the ship's position.2  
  * **Kitchenette:** A minimal galley area for food preparation.2  
  * **Gun Rack (x4):** Functional racks for storing personal firearms.2  
  * **Suit Locker (x2):** Storage lockers for armor sets and personal inventory.2  
  * **Notably Absent:** The ship lacks a functional bathroom/head, a frequent point of criticism that underscores its utilitarian nature.8 It also does not feature dedicated escape pods, reinforcing the idea that Drake ships are considered disposable.21  
* **Component Access:**  
  * **No, components are not physically accessible.** The Cutlass Black is an older ship model that has not yet undergone a "gold standard" rework. As a result, it lacks the physicalized component bays, access panels, and hatches found on more modern ships.17  
  * All component upgrades, repairs, and swaps must be performed via the Vehicle Loadout Manager interface while the ship is stored in a station hangar.17

The lack of physicalized components carries a significant hidden cost that prospective buyers must consider. The game's development trajectory is moving towards deeper engineering gameplay, where crew members will be able to perform in-field repairs by physically accessing and interacting with damaged components. Ships that have received a "gold standard" pass, like the Spirit C1 or Corsair, are designed with this future gameplay in mind, featuring accessible panels and hatches. The Cutlass Black, in its current state, is incompatible with these planned mechanics. This means it cannot be field-repaired in the same manner, placing it at a severe disadvantage in prolonged engagements or during deep-space operations once these systems are implemented. Furthermore, the popular gameplay loop of salvaging high-tier components from shipwrecks is not possible with a derelict Cutlass, as there is no physical way to remove its parts.17 This lack of future-proofing is a critical long-term trade-off for the ship's lower initial purchase price.

## **Flight Characteristics (Post-Alpha 4.2.1 Analysis)**

The flight model of the Drake Cutlass Black was fundamentally altered in the Alpha 4.2.1 patch, shifting its role away from an agile fighter towards a more ponderous gunship. Understanding these new characteristics is critical to operating the ship effectively.

* **Flight Analogy:**  
  * **"Sluggish Space Pickup Truck" or "Flying Brick":** These analogies accurately capture the ship's current handling. It is functional and capable of transporting a load, but it is not nimble or responsive in combat maneuvers.12 Some have compared it to a B-17 Flying Fortress: a weapons platform that must rely on its defensive turret and linear speed rather than its own agility to survive.23  
* **Performance in Space:**  
  * **Agility:** The ship's agility was drastically reduced in the 4.2.1 patch. It now possesses low pitch, yaw, and roll rates for a vessel of its size and intended role. It is incapable of winning a turning fight against any dedicated fighter and will be outmaneuvered by more nimble competitors like the Crusader Spirit C1.14 Its flight performance is now more akin to that of a much larger ship.12  
  * **Speed & Acceleration:** While its agility is poor, the Cutlass Black retains a respectable Standard Combat Maneuver (SCM) speed and a high top speed in non-combat NAV mode. However, its linear acceleration is only mediocre. This profile dictates its primary defensive tactic: using its boost to gain linear separation from an attacker rather than attempting to out-turn them.9  
* **Performance in Atmosphere:**  
  * The Cutlass Black is equipped with large, rotating main thrusters that provide Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) capability. Engaging VTOL mode (default key: K) is essential for efficient atmospheric flight, saving significant hydrogen fuel and improving control during takeoff and landing.19  
  * Despite its VTOL thrusters, the ship feels heavy and can be unresponsive in atmosphere. Its airframe is not aerodynamic, and it relies almost entirely on raw thruster power to maneuver, making it predictable and highly vulnerable if its engines are damaged.24

To quantify these subjective descriptions, the table below lists the key flight metrics for the Cutlass Black as of Alpha 4.2.1. These objective figures allow for direct comparison against other vessels.

| Flight Statistic | Value |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **SCM Speed** | 217 m/s |  |
| **Max Speed (NAV)** | 1,150 m/s |  |
| **Pitch Rate** | 47.0 deg/s |  |
| **Yaw Rate** | 39.0 deg/s |  |
| **Roll Rate** | 137.0 deg/s |  |

## **Components and Defenses**

The default component loadout of the Drake Cutlass Black is a clear reflection of its budget-friendly price point. Nearly all stock components are low-grade civilian models, making upgrades a top priority for any pilot intending to use the ship for more than basic transport.

The table below details the standard factory loadout for a newly purchased Cutlass Black.

| Component Type | Quantity & Size | Default Model | Grade |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Power Plant** | 1x Size 2 | DayBreak | Civilian (C) |  |
| **Cooler(s)** | 2x Size 2 | ColdSnap | Civilian (C) |  |
| **Shield Generator(s)** | 1x Size 2 | STOP | Civilian (C) |  |
| **Quantum Drive** | 1x Size 2 | Odyssey | Civilian (C) |  |
| **Pilot Weapons** | 4x Size 3 | 2x CF-337 Panther, 2x Mantis GT-220 (on S3 Gimbals) | \- |  |
| **Turret Weapons** | 2x Size 3 | 2x CF-337 Panther (on S3 Gimbals) | \- |  |
| **Missile Racks** | 4x Size 4 | 2x MSD-442 (8x S2 Missiles), 2x MSD-423 (8x S3 Missiles) | \- |  |

### **Component Upgrade Philosophy**

Given the poor quality of the stock components, pilots have developed two primary upgrade strategies based on their intended playstyle.

* **Military/Durability Meta:** This is the most common and recommended path for players who engage in any form of combat. The focus is on maximizing survivability to compensate for the ship's inherent fragility. Key upgrades include replacing the stock shield with a Military Grade A **FR-76** for its high health pool and installing a durable power plant like the **Rampart** or **Lotus** to resist disruption and damage.13 This build prioritizes resilience above all else.  
* **Stealth Meta:** A more niche, high-skill approach that aims to reduce the ship's electromagnetic (EM) and infrared (IR) signatures to delay or avoid detection by hostile scanners. This is achieved by using specialized components such as an **IceBox** cooler (often with only one of the two slots filled), a low-emission **Cirrus** power plant, and a stealth-focused quantum drive like the **Spicule** or **Bolt**.13 This strategy is best suited for solo operators who prefer evasion and surprise over direct confrontation.  
* **Priority Upgrade \- Quantum Drive:** Regardless of the chosen meta, the stock Odyssey quantum drive is exceptionally slow. Upgrading it to a faster model like the **Crossfield** (for balance) or the **XL-1** (for maximum speed) is considered an essential quality-of-life improvement, drastically reducing travel times across the Stanton system.19

A critical, unchangeable aspect of the Cutlass Black's design is its single Size 2 shield generator slot.2 Its primary competitor, the MISC Freelancer, is equipped with two Size 2 shield slots.15 In

*Star Citizen*'s mechanics, shield health and regeneration benefit immensely from multiple generators. This means that even with the best possible Size 2 shield installed, a Cutlass Black will always have significantly lower total shield health and resilience than a Freelancer equipped with two mediocre shields. This hard-coded component limitation represents a fundamental performance ceiling and is the single most important factor defining the Cutlass's fragility in combat. It dictates a tactical necessity to avoid taking damage, whereas the Freelancer can afford to absorb it.

## **Comparative Analysis: The Medium Multi-Role Market**

The Drake Cutlass Black does not operate in a vacuum. It competes directly with several other ships in the popular medium multi-role category. Its most significant rivals are the MISC Freelancer, a durable workhorse, and the Crusader Spirit C1, a modern and stylish hauler.

The following table provides a head-to-head summary of these three competitors across key performance metrics.

| Feature | Drake Cutlass Black | MISC Freelancer (Base) | Crusader Spirit C1 |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Pilot Firepower** | Good (4xS3) | Excellent (4xS3 Gimballed) | Good (4xS3) |
| **Turret** | Excellent (Manned 2xS3) | Poor (Manned 2xS2) | None |
| **Shields** | Poor (1xS2) | Excellent (2xS2) | Poor (1xS2) |
| **Hull HP** | Average | High | High |
| **Agility** | Poor (Post-nerf) | Poor | Excellent |
| **Cargo (SCU)** | 46 | 66 | 64 |
| **Vehicle Space** | Excellent (Fits ROC) | Poor (ROC fits awkwardly) | Excellent (Fits ROC) |
| **Crew Focus** | Solo / Duo | Solo / Multi | Primarily Solo |
| **Price (aUEC)** | \~2.1m | \~3.1m | \~3.1m |

### **vs. MISC Freelancer**

The comparison between the Cutlass Black and the MISC Freelancer is a classic debate of versatility versus durability. The Cutlass holds several advantages: its manned turret is far more powerful and has a much better field of fire, its side doors offer tactical flexibility that the Freelancer lacks, its wider cargo bay is better suited for vehicle transport, and it is significantly cheaper to purchase.28 It is widely considered the more versatile platform for missions that involve a mix of space combat, ground vehicles, and FPS gameplay.30

The Freelancer, however, is vastly superior in terms of survivability. Its dual shield generators give it a massive defensive advantage, which is further enhanced by a more durable hull.15 Its four pilot-controlled guns come on gimbals as standard, making it easier to land shots without sacrificing weapon size. It also boasts a larger cargo hold of 66 SCU. This makes the Freelancer the clear choice for pilots who expect to face heavy fire, wish to take on larger ship bounties, or prioritize durability over tactical flexibility.15

### **vs. Crusader Spirit C1**

The Spirit C1 represents a more modern approach to the medium hauler role and presents a stark choice against the Cutlass. The primary advantage of the Cutlass is its powerful manned turret, making it the far superior option for players who consistently fly with a gunner.5 Its smaller physical footprint can also make it easier to land in tight, unimproved landing zones. Finally, it is approximately one million aUEC cheaper.5

In almost every other metric, particularly for a solo pilot, the Spirit C1 is the superior vessel. It possesses a far better flight model, feeling agile and responsive where the Cutlass feels sluggish.9 It offers more cargo capacity (64 SCU) and features a much more useful integrated tractor beam on an internal rail system, making cargo management effortless.9 The C1 also benefits from being a "gold standard" ship with a modern, bug-free interior and better fuel efficiency.9 For a solo player focused on hauling or general use, the Spirit C1 is the better investment despite its higher price.

## **Encounter Strategy and Tactical Doctrine**

The flight model changes in Alpha 4.2.1 necessitate a complete shift in tactical thinking for Cutlass Black pilots. It can no longer be flown as a dogfighter; it must be operated as a gunship. This doctrine emphasizes managing engagement distances, avoiding turning fights, and leveraging the ship's potent forward-facing firepower and manned turret to create a lethal field of fire.7

* **Tactic vs. Light Fighters (e.g., Arrow, Gladius):**  
  * **Action: Disengage or Control the Engagement.** A turning fight with a dedicated light fighter is unwinnable. The pilot's first reaction should be to use boost to create distance in a straight line. Once separation is achieved (2-3 km), the pilot should decouple, turn the ship to face the pursuer (flying backwards), and engage with long-range weapons like laser cannons. Missiles should be used to force defensive maneuvers. This tactic is exponentially more effective with a gunner in the turret, who can maintain constant pressure on the target while the pilot focuses on managing distance and velocity.19  
* **Tactic vs. Common Pirate Ships (e.g., another Cutlass Black):**  
  * **Action: Fight with Precision.** In a peer-to-peer engagement, victory often goes to the pilot who can cripple their opponent first. The Cutlass's large, exposed engine nacelles are its greatest vulnerability. All fire should be focused on a single engine. Once one is destroyed, the target will be sent into an uncontrollable spin and can be dispatched at leisure. The presence of a gunner provides a decisive advantage. Use missiles early in the engagement to overwhelm the opponent's single shield.19  
* **Tactic vs. Larger, Less Agile Ships (e.g., Constellation, Freelancer):**  
  * **Action: Exploit Weaknesses and Manage Risk.** While the Cutlass is now sluggish, it is still more agile than a Constellation. Pilots should strive to stay in the Constellation's blind spots (typically directly above or below) to avoid its powerful main guns. An engagement against a Freelancer is a battle of attrition that the Cutlass is likely to lose due to its inferior defenses. The key is to survive the Freelancer's initial attack and use superior turret coverage to wear it down from unexpected angles. These are high-risk encounters. When undertaking PVE bounties against these larger ships (VHRTs/ERTs), the Cutlass can succeed, but the pilot must remain constantly in motion, using asteroids or other environmental cover to break line of sight and allow its single shield time to regenerate.19

## **Target Player Profile and Final Recommendation**

The Drake Cutlass Black's unique combination of strengths and weaknesses makes it an ideal choice for certain pilots, while being a source of frustration for others. Identifying its target audience is key to making an informed purchase decision.

### **Ideal Player Type**

* **The Versatile Solo/Duo Operator:** The Cutlass Black is perfect for the player who wants a single ship to experience a broad swath of the game's content. It seamlessly transitions between ROC mining, bunker-clearing FPS missions, light cargo hauling, and PVE bounty hunting. Its effectiveness is significantly amplified by a second player in the turret, making it an excellent choice for those who regularly play with one friend.7  
* **The Aspiring Pirate or Militia Member:** For players drawn to a more rugged, mercenary playstyle, the Cutlass Black's aesthetic and reputation are a perfect fit. It offers the firepower and utility needed for piracy and patrol work without the polished feel or high cost of military-grade vessels.1  
* **The Budget-Conscious Upgrader:** For a new player graduating from a starter package, the Cutlass Black offers the most gameplay variety for the lowest aUEC investment in the medium ship class. It is a cost-effective bridge to the game's more advanced professions.

### **Player Type to Avoid This Ship**

* **The Ace Dogfighter:** Pilots who thrive on agile, high-skill PvP combat will find the post-4.2.1 flight model to be profoundly disappointing and non-competitive. Ships like the Aegis Gladius or Anvil Arrow are far better suited for this role.14  
* **The Dedicated Cargo Hauler:** Players whose primary goal is to maximize profit from commodity trading should look elsewhere. The Spirit C1 and Freelancer MAX both offer significantly larger cargo holds and more efficient operation for this specific task.1  
* **The Risk-Averse Player:** Any pilot who prefers a durable ship that can withstand heavy fire will be ill-served by the Cutlass's fragile hull and single shield generator. The MISC Freelancer is the clear alternative for those who prioritize survivability.15

### **Expert Verdict**

The Drake Cutlass Black rightfully maintains its status as one of *Star Citizen's* most iconic ships. Its reputation is built on a promise of freedom and versatility that, for its price, remains unmatched. However, prospective owners must understand that the significant maneuverability reduction in Alpha 4.2.1 has fundamentally reshaped its identity. It is no longer the agile multi-role fighter of previous patches; it is now a more deliberate and sluggish gunship that rewards tactical positioning and multicrew coordination over pure piloting skill.

Its value proposition is a clear series of trade-offs: in exchange for a lower price, one sacrifices the immense durability of the MISC Freelancer and the refined solo experience of the Crusader Spirit C1. What is gained is unparalleled flexibility. It is the definitive "gateway" ship, perfectly designed to help a pilot explore the 'verse and discover their preferred career path.

**Final Recommendation:** The Drake Cutlass Black is a recommended purchase for the new or budget-conscious player who values gameplay variety above specialization and frequently plays with a partner to occupy the gunner's seat. Pilots looking to excel in any single role—be it pure combat, dedicated cargo hauling, or solo operations—should avoid it, as its more expensive competitors will offer a more focused, powerful, and ultimately more rewarding experience in their chosen field. The Cutlass Black can do almost anything, but in the current state of the 'verse, it is the master of nothing.
