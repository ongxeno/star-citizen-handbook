# RSI Aurora MR: The Complete Guide

Welcome to the 'verse, Citizen! This guide is your deep dive into one of the most iconic and reliable starter ships in Star Citizen: the **RSI Aurora MR (Marque)**. Manufactured by the legendary Roberts Space Industries, the Aurora is a testament to rugged, versatile design. It's a ship that many citizens start their journey in, and for good reason. It's a jack-of-all-trades that can introduce you to combat, hauling, and exploration.

## Ship Features & Layout

The Aurora MR is compact and functional. Knowing its layout is key to using it effectively.

### Entry & Exit Points

The Aurora has two entry points, one on each side of the main fuselage.

* **Port (Left) & Starboard (Right) Doors**: These are the primary ways to enter and exit the ship. When you approach the side, you'll see an "Enter Ship" prompt. The doors slide open, and you climb a small ladder directly into the living quarters.

### Living Quarters

The interior is spartan, designed for a pilot who values function over luxury.

* **Bed**: The most prominent feature is the **bed**, located directly behind the pilot's seat. This isn't just for decoration; you can lie down and, most importantly, **log out safely in space**. This will save your ship's position, allowing you to resume your session where you left off.
* **Head/Kitchenette**: The Aurora MR does **not** have a dedicated head (toilet) or kitchenette. It's built for short-range trips.

### Internal Storage

* **Personal Inventory**: The Aurora MR has a small internal storage compartment for personal items like armor, weapons, and consumables. You can access this by standing inside the cabin, opening your mobiGlas (`F2`), and selecting the "Vehicle" tab in your personal inventory (`I`). The access point is a small, unmarked panel on the interior wall near the bed.

### Component Access Points

**Important Note**: As of Alpha 3.23, most ship components are **not yet physicalized**. This means you cannot physically pull them out for repair or salvage. All component management, swapping, and maintenance is done through the **Vehicle Loadout Manager** in your mobiGlas (`F2` -> Vehicle Icon). The locations below are where the components are intended to be physically located on the ship's model.

* **Power Plant (x1)**: Housed internally within the main central fuselage.
* **Coolers (x2)**: Located on the exterior of the main body, typically under panels near the wings.
* **Shield Generators (x2)**: Integrated into the wings/engine pylons.
* **Quantum Drive (x1)**: Located in the aft section of the ship, integrated with the main engine housing.

### Weapon & Missile Hardpoints

The Aurora MR punches above its weight with four weapon hardpoints and a missile rack. Access is via the Vehicle Loadout Manager, but for future salvage/repair with a tractor beam, here are the locations.

* **Wingtip Hardpoints (x2 Size 1)**:
    * **Location**: At the very end of each main wing. These come empty by default.
    * **Tractor Beam Access**: To pull a weapon from this hardpoint, aim your tractor beam at the weapon itself and pull directly outwards, away from the wingtip.

* **Chin Hardpoints (x2 Size 1)**:
    * **Location**: Directly under the cockpit, on a pylon extending from the "chin" of the ship. These are equipped with two RSI Badger Laser Repeaters by default.
    * **Tractor Beam Access**: Aim at the weapon and pull it straight down and slightly forward.



* **Missile Rack (x1 Size 2)**:
    * **Location**: On a dedicated pylon on the ship's dorsal (top) side, just behind the cockpit. It comes equipped with a rack holding two Size 1 missiles.
    * **Tractor Beam Access**: Aim for the entire missile rack assembly and pull it straight up, away from the ship's hull.

### Cargo Grid

The Aurora MR features an external cargo grid capable of holding **3 $SCU$** (Standard Cargo Units).

* **Location**: The cargo box attaches to the underside of the ship, just behind the cockpit and chin weapons.
* **Usage**: You must purchase a cargo box (like the `RSI Aurora Box 3 SCU`) and attach it via the Vehicle Loadout Manager. Once attached, you can buy and sell commodities at trading terminals, and the cargo will appear in this external container. It's vulnerable to fire, so be careful!

## Cockpit Features

The Aurora's cockpit is functional, with three main Multi-Function Displays (MFDs).



* **Left & Right MFDs**: These are your primary interaction screens. You can customize them to show:
    * **Weapons**: Manage capacitor assignment, gimbal modes, and missile status.
    * **Power**: Reroute power between Weapons, Shields, and Engines.
    * **Shields**: View the status of your front, back, top, and bottom shields.
    * **Targets**: Display detailed information on your current friendly or hostile target.
* **Center MFD**: Often used for **Comms** (F11) or a secondary target view.
* **HUD (Heads-Up Display)**: Your central display showing your ship's velocity, altitude, weapon capacitor levels, and targeting reticle.
* **Key Interactions**:
    * **`R`**: Flight Ready (Powers on the entire ship).
    * **`I`**: Engines On/Off.
    * **`O`**: Shields On/Off.
    * **`P`**: Weapons On/Off.
    * **Right-Alt + `R`**: Jettison Cargo (use with caution!).
    * Buttons on the console allow you to open/close doors and raise/lower landing gear without using keybinds.

## Flight Characteristics

The Aurora MR is often described as a "space pickup truck."

* **In Space**: It's not the most agile ship. Its turning and roll rates are sluggish compared to dedicated fighters. However, it's fairly durable for its size and has a small cross-section, making it a harder target to hit than you might think.
* **In Atmosphere**: Its lack of agility is more pronounced in atmosphere. It struggles with high-G turns and can feel heavy. It has enough thrust to handle most planetary environments but won't be winning any races. Its main strength is its predictability; it flies like a brick, but it's a *consistent* brick.

## Ship Comparisons

### Ships in the Same Class (Starters)

* **vs. Consolidated Outland Mustang Alpha**: The classic rivalry.
    * **Aurora MR**: More durable, has an interior with a bed (allowing for log-out saves anywhere), and better missile capabilities by default. It's the better choice for a player who wants a forgiving ship that can do a little bit of everything.
    * **Mustang Alpha**: More agile and faster, with better default firepower (4x Size 1 hardpoints usable from the start). However, it's less durable and has no interior or bed. It's for the player who wants to get straight into dogfighting and values maneuverability over utility.

* **vs. Drake Cutter**:
    * **Aurora MR**: Better combat profile with four weapon hardpoints to the Cutter's two. It's smaller and a slightly harder target to hit.
    * **Drake Cutter**: Significantly better utility. It boasts 4 $SCU$ of internal cargo (protected from damage), a small vehicle ramp, more living space with a toilet and weapon rack, and better Quantum Fuel range. The Cutter is a superior mini-hauler and utility ship, but the Aurora MR will win a direct 1v1 fight if flown well.

### Confronting Other Ship Classes

* **Against a ship above its class (e.g., Aegis Avenger Titan)**:
    * **Analysis**: The Avenger Titan outclasses you in almost every way: it's faster, more agile, has a bigger (Size 4) nose gun, and is tougher.
    * **Course of Action**: **Do not engage in a head-on fight.** Your best bet is to force an overshoot by decoupling and spinning to keep your guns on target while they fly past. Use your small size to your advantage. If their shields are down, focus fire with all four of your laser repeaters. If you have the chance, your best course of action is almost always to quantum jump away.

* **Against a dedicated fighter (e.g., Aegis Gladius)**:
    * **Analysis**: This is a fight you cannot win. The Gladius is a military-grade light fighter. It is faster, monumentally more agile, and has superior firepower and shields.
    * **Course of Action**: **Flee. Immediately.** Do not attempt to fight. Your only goal is survival. Fly erratically, use asteroids or terrain for cover, and try to align for a quantum jump as quickly as possible. Your ship is cheap to replace; don't give them the satisfaction of an easy kill.

## Who is this ship for?

The **RSI Aurora MR** is for:

* **The Brand New Player**: It is arguably the most forgiving starter ship. Its durability and bed give new players a safety net that others lack.
* **The Aspiring All-Rounder**: It allows you to sample low-tier bounty hunting, simple cargo runs, courier missions, and basic exploration without needing to specialize.
* **The Practical Pilot**: For a veteran player, a fully-upgraded Aurora can be a surprisingly effective and cheap runabout or a "sleeper" ship for unassuming missions.

It's a ship you may eventually upgrade from, but it's one you'll always look back on with respect. It teaches you the fundamentals of flying, fighting, and living in the Star Citizen universe. Fly safe, Citizen! o7
