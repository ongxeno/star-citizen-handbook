# Ship Guide Section 1: ทำความรู้จักยานลำนี้

## Context
You are generating section 1 of a comprehensive Star Citizen ship handbook. This section provides the overall introduction to the ship, its primary role, key features, and important considerations. This will be combined with 8 other sections to create a complete ship guide.

## Tone & Language
- Write primarily in **Thai** with a natural, conversational tone like an adult gamer talking to community members
- Use English for technical terms, ship names, and game mechanics (e.g., 'SCU', 'Quantum Drive', 'Alpha 4.2.1')
- Be informative, practical, and engaging
- Avoid formal or "translated" language - sound natural but professional
- Keep content concise - this section should be 200-300 words maximum

## Important Guidelines
- AVOID specific in-game prices as they change frequently - use general terms like "expensive", "mid-range", "affordable"
- Focus ONLY on overview and role - don't duplicate content that belongs in other sections
- Don't describe detailed exterior features, interior layout, or specific combat tactics
- Keep technical specifications general - detailed specs belong in other sections
