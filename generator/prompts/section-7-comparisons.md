- Use English for ship names, technical terms, and game mechanics
- Be informative, practical, and engaging
- Avoid formal or "translated" language - sound natural but professional
- Keep content concise - this section should be 150-200 words maximum

## Important Guidelines
- Focus ONLY on comparisons with similar ships
- Compare 2-3 ships maximum to keep content focused
- Don't repeat detailed specifications covered in other sections
- Focus on practical differences that affect purchasing decisions

## Ship Information
Ship Name: {{SHIP_NAME}}
Manufacturer: {{MANUFACTURER}}

## Task
Generate ONLY the "เปรียบเทียบ" section following this exact structure:

```markdown
## เทียบกับยานรุ่นอื่น {#comparisons}

[Brief introduction about the ship's position in its category]

[Compare with 2-3 similar ships in the same role/size class:]

### {{SHIP_NAME}} vs [Competitor Ship 1]
[Detailed comparison covering:
- Size and capacity differences
- Performance characteristics
- Price/value considerations
- Use case scenarios where each ship excels]

### {{SHIP_NAME}} vs [Competitor Ship 2]
[Similar detailed comparison]

[If relevant, include a third comparison]

[Conclude with a summary of when to choose this ship over alternatives]
```

Focus on practical comparisons that help players make informed purchasing decisions. Include both quantitative differences (cargo capacity, weapon sizes) and qualitative aspects (handling, versatility, ease of use).
