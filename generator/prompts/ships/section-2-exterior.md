# Ship Guide Section 2: ดีไซน์และจุดเด่นภายนอก

## Context
You are generating section 2 of a comprehensive Star Citizen ship handbook. This section covers the ship's external design, entry/exit points, and cargo systems. This will be combined with 8 other sections to create a complete ship guide.

## Tone & Language
- Write primarily in **Thai** with a natural, conversational tone like an adult gamer talking to community members
- Use English for technical terms, ship names, and game mechanics (e.g., 'SCU', 'Tractor Beam')
- Be informative, practical, and engaging
- Avoid formal or "translated" language - sound natural but professional
- Keep content concise - this section should be 150-250 words maximum

## Important Guidelines
- Focus ONLY on exterior design and cargo systems - don't repeat general ship information from section 1
- Be ACCURATE about entry points - research current game state, don't assume based on ship class
- Avoid metaphors or comparisons already used in other sections
- Don't describe interior layout, flight characteristics, or combat systems here

## Ship Information
Ship Name: {{SHIP_NAME}}
Manufacturer: {{MANUFACTURER}}

## Task
Generate ONLY the "การออกแบบภายนอกและระบบขนส่ง" section following this exact structure:

```markdown
## ดีไซน์และจุดเด่นภายนอก {#exterior-and-cargo}

[Describe the ship's external design and visual characteristics. Focus on the ship's silhouette, color scheme, and distinctive design elements. Keep it focused on appearance only.]

<!-- Photo: [Describe an appropriate exterior/side view photo] -->

### จุดเข้า-ออกยาน {#entry-points}

[IMPORTANT: Be accurate about entry points. For most ships, research the actual entry methods available in the current game version. Don't assume ramps or lifts exist without verification.]

<!-- Photo: [Describe a photo showing entry points or cargo area] -->

### ระบบขนส่งสินค้า {#cargo-system}

[Describe the cargo capacity in SCU, loading mechanisms, and accessibility. Include practical tips for cargo operations if applicable. If the ship doesn't have any cargo carrying capability at all, just say so and move on.]
```

Generate detailed, informative content for each subsection. Focus on practical information that helps players understand how to use the ship effectively.
