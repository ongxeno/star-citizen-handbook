Welcome to the 'Verse, Citizen! This guide will walk you through the essential first steps of every session: waking up, getting to your ship, and flying out of the atmosphere. We'll use Area18 on ArcCorp as our example, but the steps are very similar in all major cities.

## Step 1: Waking Up and Leaving Your Hab

You'll always start your journey by waking up in a habitat (hab).

1.  **Get Up:** Press the `Y` key to get out of bed.
2.  **Find the Door:** Look for the door to your hab. As you approach it, an "Open" prompt will appear.
3.  **Interact:** Press and hold the `F` key to activate interaction mode, then click the "Open" button with your mouse.
4.  **Exit:** Walk out into the main habitat building.

## Step 2: Navigating to the Spaceport

Your next goal is the city's spaceport, where your ships are stored.

1.  **Find the Elevator:** Follow the signs in the hab building for "Exit" or "Lobby". You'll need to take an elevator down to the ground floor.
2.  **Follow the Signs:** Once outside, look for signs directing you to the **"City-Flight Transit"** or **"Spaceport"**. In Area18, this is the City-Flight transit line.
3.  **Ride the Train:** Wait for the train to arrive, get on, and enjoy the view. The train will take you directly to the Riker Memorial Spaceport.

## Step 3: Retrieving Your Ship

You've made it to the spaceport. Time to call your ride.

1.  **Find the ASOP Terminal:** Inside the spaceport, follow signs for the **"ASOP Vehicle Retrieval Terminals"**. These are computer screens, usually in a row.
2.  **Interact with the Terminal:** Press `F` to interact with a screen.
3.  **Select Your Ship:** A list of your available ships will appear. Click the ship you want to fly.
4.  **Retrieve:** Click the **"Retrieve"** button. The terminal will assign you a landing pad number (e.g., "Hangar 05"). Make a note of this number.

## Step 4: Pre-Flight and Takeoff

Almost there! Now you just need to get to your ship and start it up.

1.  **Find the Hangar Elevator:** Turn around from the ASOP terminals and look for the hangar elevators.
2.  **Select Your Hangar:** Interact with the elevator panel and select the hangar number the ASOP terminal gave you.
3.  **Board Your Ship:** The elevator will take you to your ship. Find the ramp or cockpit ladder (look for an "Open" prompt) and get inside.
4.  **Enter the Pilot's Seat:** Sit down in the pilot's seat by holding `F` and clicking the "Enter Pilot Seat" prompt.
5.  **Power On & Flight Ready:**
    * Press `U` to turn on all ship power.
    * Press `R` to enter "Flight Ready" mode. You'll hear the ship's systems power up.
6.  **Contact ATC (Air Traffic Control):**
    * Press `F11` to open your comms menu.
    * Select the "Friends" tab at the bottom.
    * The top contact will be the local ATC (e.g., "Area18 ATC"). Click the small icon to the right of their name to hail them.
    * Wait for them to say "You are clear for launch" and for the hangar doors above you to open.
7.  **Takeoff:**
    * Press `Spacebar` to apply upward thrust and lift gently off the pad.
    * Press `N` to raise your landing gear.
    * Fly straight up and out of the hangar.

## Step 5: Reaching Orbit

You're flying! The last step is to leave the planet's gravity well.

1.  **Aim Up:** Point the nose of your ship straight up, perpendicular to the ground.
2.  **Engage Quantum Drive:**
    * Press `B` to spool your Quantum Drive. You'll see calibration happening on your HUD.
    * Look for a diamond-shaped icon on your screen. This is the local orbital station (e.g., Baijini Point).
    * Once calibration is complete and the icon is green, **press and hold `B`** to initiate the jump.

Congratulations! You've successfully traveled from your hab to an orbital station. You are now ready to explore the 'Verse.
